"Authors have the option of either creating and editing their book within the "
"Chesstempo book editor, or importing book content in PGN format. Currently "
"we recommend most of the editing work to be done in external PGN and then "
"imported for final edits in the editor if required. We provide a PGN based "
"format that uses a number of custom tags and annotations to describe the "
"book structure, and targeting this format will provide the most trouble free "
"imports. We can handle importing generic PGN, but PGN which tries to target "
"our format will require less editing, and in many cases will be immediately "
"ready for publishing. You can read the <a href=\"/manual/en/manual."

"If you use Chessbase as your main platform for editing chess material, then "

"custom PGN tags and annotations, so you may find the final stages of book "
"creation are best done in a tool that better supports a full range of PGN "
"editing functionality, and will allow you to create arbitrary tags and "

msgid "How the tag voting works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tag voting adds up all the votes for and against a particular tag on a "
"problem and if there is more votes for the tag than against then the problem "
"will be marked as having that tag.  This means that if you already see a "
"problem with a tag that you agree with, then it would be useful for you to "
"add your vote for the tag even though the problem was already marked with "
"that tag.  The reason for this is that if there was only one vote for the "
"tag and someone else incorrectly voted against the tag, then the tag would "
"become inactive (coloured red), however if you add your vote for the tag "
"then it would take two votes against the tag to disable it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users can only vote for a particular tag once on a problem, however users "
"CAN vote for multiple different tags per problems, so if you see more than "
"one appropriate tag for a problem, please vote for all of them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of votes for and against a tag are shown when hovering over the "
"tag.  You can click on the + or - votes to add for or against votes to an "
"existing tag, or you can use the + button beneath the tags to vote for new "
"tags, and the available tags to select from will be displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the list of tags already applied, you can click on the tag name to see a "
"description of the tag if you want to check your understanding of the tag "
"definition before voting. If you haven't voted on a tag before or haven't "
"voted recently, you'll also be shown the description view, even when "
"clicking directly on the up/down vote scores to add your vote."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When choosing a new tag, the tags are layed out in a folder structure in the "
"tag selection panel. Higher level folders such as 'Non-mate Motifs' can't be "
"voted on directly, however some folders are also voteable tags, for example "
"inside the 'Non-mate Motifs' folder you'll find a 'Discovery' folder. You "
"can vote directly on the 'Discovery' folder (click on the name instead of "
"the expand/collapse icon to vote on a folder tag). Voting on child tags of "
"such a voteable folder tag will also vote on any voteable parents that lead "
"to the child tag being voted on. For example there is a 'Discover Checks' "
"tag inside the 'Discovered Attack' folder that is inside the 'Discovery' "
"folder. So the 'Discover Checks' tag has the full folder path of 'Tactical "
"Motifs -> Non-mate Motifs -> Discovery -> Discovered Attack -> Discoverer "
"Checks'. If you vote on 'Discoverer Checks' then 'Discovered Attack' and "
"'Discovery' will also have your vote applied. This allows more flexibility "
"in the custom set search, as it means by voting for 'Discoverer Checks' "
"people will also be able to find items you've tagged in this way via the "
"higher level motifs of 'Discovery' or 'Discovered Attack'. Down votes work "
"in the same way as up votes in the folder hierachy, so a down vote for "
"'Discoverer Checks' will also down vote its relevant parents."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One of the reasons we tag positions is to allow users to find positions that "
"contain a tactical motif that they want to study.  For example, if a person "
"wants to study pins, they can create (or use a pre-made) custom set which "
"targets pins.  The search results will include only those positions that "
"have previously been tagged as pins.  This is important to remember when "
"tagging a position.  Let's say that you are solving a tactical puzzle and "
"you want to add the tag 'pin' to that particular problem.  Before adding "
"that tag, ask yourself the following question:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If I were searching for pins, is this an important position that I would "
"want to see in my search results?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the answer is \"yes\", then add the tag.  If the answer is \"no\", then "
"the tag should not be added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tag modifiers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tag modifiers allow more specific versions of tags to be represented without "
"creating a massive number of new top level tags. For example it may be "
"useful to recognize that a motif occurs with check, or that a particular "
"piece was moved during the tactic. For example a Fork with check could be "
"presented by Fork[Check,Knight] indicating that a Knight delivered a fork "
"with check."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modifiers can only be added when creating a new tag. You can't add a "
"modifier to a tag that has already been added to a problem. This means if "
"there is an existing Fork tag with no modifiers, and you want to add a "
"Fork[Check,Knight] tag, you would need to add a new tag using the '+' "
"button , and then on the add tag panel, choose the Check and Knight "
"modifiers. We also want to avoid an acculumation of the same tag with "
"different sets of modifiers , so if you believe your new tag with modifiers "
"is the most specific available, then you should also vote down Fork tags "
"without modifiers. The tag without modifiers is not wrong, but your new tag "
"is more specific, so we would prefer that it becomes the primary way of "
"tagging the Fork on the problem. People using tag searches based on 'Fork' "
"will still find the modifier version, with the added bonus of also being "
"able to search for problems with more specific versions involving check or "
"the specific piece involved. If other taggers agree with your modifiers, "
"they can click directly on your modifier version of the tag to vote it up "
"without having to add their own modifier version, and they can also vote "
"down the less specific version."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We currently support three types of modifiers, the Check modifier, the "
"attacking piece modifier (Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen , King) and the "
"Prophylaxis modifer. The Check modifier is to be used when the motif "
"involves checking the opponent king. The attacking piece modifier designates "
"the piece(s) involved in the attack. The Prophylaxis modifier provides a way "
"of indicating that a move is required in order to protect against a "
"potential attack from your opponent. It is most commonly applicable on mixed "
"mode defensive problems, but may also be relevant in non-defensive tactics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that piece modifiers (Pawn, Bishop, Knight, Rook, Queen , King) "
"only refer to the moving piece, please don't use these to denote the type of "
"pieces attacked. So for example a Fork[King] is a fork made by a King on two "
"pieces, NOT a fork on a king. Similarly Pin[Rook] is pin where a rook is "
"pinning another piece, NOT a pin on a rook. You can use the piece modifier "
"for opponent pieces when combined with the Prophylaxis modifier, indicating "
"the opponent piece is the piece capable of making the potential threat. "
"Similarly if a move is a prophylactic move that defends against check from "
"your opponent, then tagging with both Prophylaxis and Check as modifiers is "
"also fine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a small number of tags , modifiers will be redundant , as we decided to "
"have a specific tag that overlaps with a modifier. For example 'Discoverer "
"Checks' could be 'Discovered Attack[Check]'. To avoid clutter it is best to "
"avoid marking 'Discoverer Checks' with the Check modifier, given the name "
"already holds this information."

msgid "Using positional motifs"
msgstr "Tactische Thema's"

msgid ""
"Initially, positional motifs were only available for tagging positions in "
"the <a href=\"/guess-the-move/\">Guess the move</a> feature. However we now "
"allow positional tags to be used in chess problems. When deciding if a "
"positional tag could be used on a problem, please try to limit tagging to "
"features that were relevant to the problem solution. For example, if a "
"tactical position has connected pawns, but they don't feature in the tactic, "
"then they should not be tagged. If however, the tactic involves utilising an "
"advanced pawn to gain material, it is possible the connected nature of your "
"pawns was relevant, and if that is the case, they should be tagged. Some "
"positional motifs will tend to be more commonly associated with tactics than "
"others. For example motifs in the positional list like 'Rook On 7th Rank', "
"'Pawn Storm', 'Rook Lift' will tend to be more commonly featured in tactics "
"problems than some of the less aggressive positional tags."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tags for tactical threats that are not played out"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes a tactic involves the threat of a particular tactical motif , but "
"the tactical motif itself is not actually played out on the board (for "
"example the opponent gives up a minor piece to avoid a fork on more valuable "
"material).  In these situations it is ok to tag the problem with the "
"threatened tag as long as the threat was important in making the tactic "
"work.  Incidental threats that are not relevant to the main line should not "
"be tagged."
msgstr ""

msgid "Needs more Moves and Needs different opponent moves tags"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are special purpose tags that prompt the user for a move suggested the "
"user feels would lead to an improvement in the tactic."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"'Needs more moves' should be used when the problem finished early and would "
"benefit from more moves in order to force the user to see the point of the "
"tactic.  You are asked to enter a single move which would be the next move "
"in the move sequence (usually an extra opponent move).  While you may feel "
"that multiple extra moves are required, you are only asked to enter the very "
"next move. This will make the automatic extension of problems much easier to "
"handle (although it may mean that sometimes a subsequent move extension vote "
"may need to be made, in many situations the auto-extension will be able to "
"fill in more than one extra move once the first move has been provided).  So "
"for example if the the move sequence ended after two user moves with 1...Nf3 "
"2.Rxf3 Qxf3 and you felt that 3.Bxf3 Rxf3 should have been played, then you "
"would use the 'Needs more moves' tag and enter 3.Bxf3 as the extra move."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The 'Needs different opponent move' tag should be used when you believe a "
"move played by the opponent prevented the main point of the problem being "
"shown, or that a different opponent move would have been more instructive.  "
"In this case you enter the the move that you believe should replace an "
"existing move, for example if the main line was 1...Nf3 2.Rxf3 Bxf3 (with "
"white giving up the rook to avoid losing the queen in the future), and you "
"think that forcing the user to find the longer queen winning move would be "
"more instructive, then you could suggest 2.Rf4 which might be a move that "
"would force black to prove they can see the more difficult queen winning "
"sequence.  Note that the 'Needs different opponent move' tag should not be "
"used to suggest 'silly' moves that a human wouldn't play just in order to "
"reveal a pretty tactical line.  The suggested move should always be a move "
"that gives the winning side a chance to go astray and miss the win (even if "
"the move might have lower computer evaluations in the longer term)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are unsure of the quality of your suggested move then using an engine "
"to check your analysis would be beneficial.  There may also be some "
"situations where there is no clear good move and a human player would "
"probably just resign. A good guidelines here (and in other situations) is to "
"suggest the move that poses the most difficult questions of the opponent "
"(which in this case is you)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with the standard tactical motif tags, it is very useful for you to add "
"an extra 'for' vote for a 'need more moves' or 'needs different opponent "
"move' tag if you see an improved move suggestion that you agree with.  Not "
"only does this help keep useful suggestions around in the situation where "
"other users incorrectly vote against the tag, but once auto-adjustment of "
"problems is implemented, the problems that are processed first will be the "
"ones with the most tags."

"Chess Tactics Server (aka chess.emrald.net) - Now no longer available, CTS "
"was the first place we know of to implement the idea of rating chess puzzles "
"via a chess rating system by treating solving activity in the same way as "
"matches between players. Work on Chesstempo was already well progressed when "
"we first became aware of CTS (which predated CT by several years), but we "
"hadn't finalised our scoring and difficulty grading system. Upon seeing how "
"elegantly CTS's rating system worked, we borrowed the idea of treating "
"puzzles and human solvers as opponents. Implementing our own version for use "
"on Chesstempo, we supplemented CTS's timed solving with an untimed mode, and "
"thus \"blitz\" and \"standard\" modes on Chesstempo were born.  CTS was "

"https://beta.chesstempo.com/play-chess-online/\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Playing on Chesstempo has grown dramatically since the feature was first "
"made available in January 2015. You can see the\n"
"growth over time on the following graph:\n"
"![Playing growth on chesstempo](/images/growth.png)\n"
"\n"
"We've grown from around 60,000 games played per month in February 2015 to "
"over 450,000 played during last month. \n"
"\n"
"While the new UI is mostly an update to the look of the new site, there have "
"been significant new features\n"
"added over the last 2.5 years that you may not have seen if you haven't "
"visited since our first launch, including:\n"
"\n"
"- Engine analysis and annotation of every rated game played on the site. "
"Analysis is usually returned in only a few\n"
" seconds by  spreading the analysis out over hundreds of cloud engines. Not "
"only does this provide useful and timely\n"
" feedback on  your game performance, but also drives data collection for "
"powerful cheat detection algorithms.\n"
"- Extraction of tactical positions from your games which can be solved in "
"the tactics interface (either right away,\n"
" or at any time in the future). Extracted problems can also be filtered "
"using the powerful custom set features.\n"
"- Abandoned game detection - if a user abandons a game by either "
"disconnecting,\n"
"or ceasing to play moves you will be given the  option to claim a win or "
"abort the game if they do not resume\n"
"playing in a reasonable period of time. \n"
"- Create unrated games from arbitrary start positions.\n"
"- Visibility of think times and clock changes while moving through the move "
"list on completed games. After the game is\n"
" over you can move through the move list and the clocks will update to show "
"the time they had at that point in the\n"
" game. \n"
"- Guests can play without registering. Some restrictions apply such as not "
"being able to chat, create rated seeks,\n"
" or respond to the seeks of registered users.\n"
"- Define who can send you direct seeks, and under what conditions, using a "
"seek formula to provide fine tuning of seek\n"
" preferences. \n"
"- Block users you do not want to play again. Blocked users will not be able "
"to send you seeks, answer your seeks or chat with you.\n"
"- Seek Favourites - if you have a favourite seek type that is not one of the "
"defaults, you can enter the seek details\n"
" and then save the seek as a favourite which will create a new button in the "
"seek dialog that can be clicked on in the\n"
" future. Start positions, rating ranges and opponent names can all be saved "
"in the favourite.\n"
"- Hide ratings mode - in your preferences you can turn on hide ratings mode "
"which avoids display rating information in the game view while you are "
"playing.\n"
"- Chat disabling - toggle chat on and off using the cross/tick icon in the "
"chat window.\n"
"- Allow earlier aborts if your opponent does not make their first move "
"within a reasonable time period. \n"
"- Option to turn on move confirmations for correspondence games only.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"While the beta playing is largely feature equivalent to the old site, there "
"have been a few small improvements made such\n"
"as:\n"
"- Ability to jump directly to the tactics solving page to solve the most "
"recent problems extracted from your games.\n"
"- Previously, game history on the playing page was limited to the last 20 "
"games, and you had to go to your game database\n"
"page to see older games. The new history list will now scroll infinitely , "
"allowing you to move back as far as you like\n"
"in your game history without leaving the playing page.\n"
"- Improved display of head to head stats between you and your opponent.\n"
"- Keyboard bindings to quickly switch between the challenge list (c), game "
"history (h), your active games (g), and the\n"
"playing board view (b).\n"
"- Improved seek list user interactions, making it easier to avoid seek "
"misclicks. We still have a seek accept\n"
"confirmation step, but you can also avoid that by double clicking the seek "
"you are accepting.\n"
"- Improved options for pre-move highlighting.\n"
"\n"
"We've tried to aim for the most streamlined UI possible, and as a result "
"some features have been removed in favour of\n"
"simplicity. The multiple game tabs feature is no longer available. A tab per "
"game made the UI messy, and had several\n"
"annoying behaviours, such as multiple games with the same person spreading "
"game chats out over multiple game windows.\n"
"Old games can still be switched to via links to each game in the chat "
"window, or by bringing up your game history.\n"
"For now, we are experimenting with removing the seek graph view in favour of "
"only having a seek list which was the more\n"
"popular of the two seek views. Depending on demand, we may consider bringing "
"back the seek graph before the beta shifts to being the default site.\n"

"We are working on converting all features to the new beta site, but for now, "
"the tactics training , custom set creation,\n"
"and some related new features are available.  The changes are discussed in "
"detail below.\n"
"\n"
"# Tactics Solving Page\n"
"\n"
"The [new tactics training page](/chess-tactics/) provides a cleaner solving "
"interface by removing some clutter from\n"
"the top level interface. A number of new features have also been added:\n"
"\n"
"- Distraction free solving mode that provides a fullscreen , board only "
"solving view that removes all other UI elements\n"
"other than the board. To try the distraction free mode, choose fullscreen "
"mode via the action menu (click the icon with\n"
"three horizontal bars in a blue circle shown under the move list). Next time "
"you start a problem, it will be presented\n"
"in distraction free mode. If you'd like to use fullscreen mode without the "
"distraction free feature, you can turn off\n"
"the mode in the solving menu of your preferences.\n"
"\n"
"- A new session details panel can be expanded on the left to see a rating "
"graph of your recent attempts in the\n"
"current problem set. Points on the graph can be hovered over with the mouse "
"to view a mini-board , and problem details\n"
"for each previous attempt. Clicking on any of the points will load the "
"problem for viewing. The session details panel\n"
"also contains some summary data for the current session, such as total "
"rating change for session, average time spent per\n"
"problem and session performance rating. The end session button, current set "
"name and change set button have also been\n"
"moved into the session details panel. If you need to end the session while "
"still solving a problem, you can toggle the\n"
"session panel with the icon under the solving board.\n"
"\n"
"- Difficulty level can now be set at the start of the session, or via the "
"session details panel. Difficulty settings are\n"
"now per-problem set, so you no longer have to switch between difficulty "
"modes if for example you want blitz problems in\n"
"easy mode, and standard or mixed problems in hard mode.\n"
"\n"
"# Cloud engines\n"
"\n"
"Due to browser vendors making it increasingly difficult to run the java "
"plugin , we have created an alternative\n"
"method of in-browser engine analysis for gold members which uses Komodo and "
"Stockfish engines running on Chesstempo\n"
"servers. These have been running on the main site for several weeks, and are "
"now the default engine analysis method. If\n"
"you would prefer to continue to use the Java based engine interface, you can "
"turn off cloud engines in your preferences,\n"
"however we will soon be removing the Java based engine functionality.\n"
"\n"
"# Automatic game analysis of all rated games played on Chesstempo\n"
"\n"
"All rated games played on the [play online](http://chesstempo.com/play-chess-"
"online.html) page will be analysed and\n"
"annotated. By spreading the analysis across all our cloud engines, game "
"analysis returns very quickly (usually in around\n"
"5-10 seconds). An evaluation and think time graph is provided for both "
"players, along with a summary of engine\n"
"deviations , and move quality. The move list is annotated with the result of "
"the engine analysis, with blunders,\n"
"mistakes and inaccuracies highlighted. To see the analysis, after the game "
"is over, wait for the 'pending analysis..'\n"

"tuning a new cheat detection system based on analysing over 50 different "
"data points for each game.\n"
"\n"
"# Problems from your own games\n"
"\n"
"For gold members, during the post-game engine analysis, important tactics "
"you missed during the game are\n"
"extracted and added to a personal set of your own problems that you can "
"train in the Chesstempo tactics solving\n"
"interface. You can also use the custom set features to create 'my games' "
"sets using advanced problem set features, such\n"
"as attempt history filters and spaced repetition, or if you tag your own "
"problems, specific tactical motifs.\n"
"\n"
"You need to use the [solving interface on the beta site](https://beta."
"chesstempo.com/chess-tactics/) to access your 'my\n"
"games' problems. When you use the change set button, you'll see a 'From my "
"games' folder where you can select from several\n"
"'my games' problem set types. The solving interface is slightly different to "
"the old tactics in that the path through\n"
"the problem is not pre-determined, but guided by a live cloud engine during "
"solving. This means solving can take longer\n"
"while you wait for the engine to analyse the next move, but the advantage is "
"that positions can be used that were\n"
"previously discarded due to ambiguity, as the engine can follow any correct "
"line, and doesn't require a single main line\n"
"solution. A wide range of problem types are also generated, with the "
"composition being similar to the mixed tactic mode,\n"
"where both winning and non-winning tactics are included. Two main types of "
"tactics are generated:\n"
"1. Positions where your opponent blundered, and you failed to take advantage "
"of the blunder. \n"
"2. Position where you blundered, allowing your opponent to win material or "
"mate.\n"
"\n"
"The latter types will often only require one move where any move which "
"avoids the material loss from your in game\n"
"blunder will be deemed correct.\n"
"\n"
"After solving, the move list will contain the top engine moves, as well as "
"the move that you played in\n"
"the original game. The game move is often important information in "
"understanding why the problem was generated, as\n"
"blunders where you simply need to play a non-losing move may be hard to "
"understand if you are not reminded\n"
"of your in game mistake move.\n"
"\n"
"We don't currently produce every missed tactic in the game, as we try to "
"avoid tactics where even the best move would\n"
"have left you in a very lost position (down a rook or worse), or the mistake "
"move still left you clearly ahead. One\n"
"exception is missing short mates where we've decided training the missed "
"mating pattern is still useful even if you\n"
"played a move in the game that was still winning. If you'd like to increase "
"or decrease the range of problem types\n"
"generated, a number of generation parameters can be tuned via preference "
"settings.\n"
"\n"
"The average number of problems produced per game with default settings will "
"differ depending on your playing strength\n"
"and the time control you play. The average player will get about 1-2 new "
"problems per game.\n"
"\n"
"If you find generated problems you don't want to do again, you can give them "
"1 star quality votes which will permanently filter them out in the pre-"
"canned sets.  They will still be accessible in custom sets if you set a "
"minimum quality filter of 0.\n"
"\n"
"# Custom sets\n"
"\n"
"The custom sets/problem search page has several new options:\n"
"\n"
"- New tag expression builder. Previously you could only specify a list of "
"tactical tags, and if a problem had any of\n"
"those tags, it would be included in the search result. This meant it was "
"impossible to specify searches such as \"give me\n"
"problems that have both a Pin AND a Fork\", as selecting both those tags "
"would select problems with at least one of the\n"
"two tags, but not both. The new tag expression builder allows not only 'AND' "
"operations, but also 'NOT' operations. For\n"
"example you can now specify complex expression such as (Fork AND (Pin OR "
"Distraction)) AND NOT Discovered Attack.\n"
"Combined with personal tags the NOT expression can be useful in avoiding "
"problems you never want to see in your set\n"
"again. For example you could create a personal tag \"Don't show me\", and a "
"custom set using a (NOT \"Don't show me\")\n"
"expression. Then whenever you see a problem you never want to see in that "
"set again, you can tag it with your \"Don't\n"
"show me\" personal tag, and it will be automatically removed from your "
"custom set.\n"
"\n"
"- Custom set editing. Previously it was impossible to change a set once it "
"was created. This meant if you wanted to\n"
"change your problem set parameters after creation, you'd need to delete your "
"old set, and create a new one. This was\n"
"particularly annoying for spaced repetition sets, as you would also loose "
"your previous learning history that was tied\n"
"to the set. With custom set editing, you can now do things like modify "
"rating ranges, add tags to searches, or change\n"
"spaced repetition parameters such as those impacting the scheduling gap "
"between attempts, and future attempts will\n"
"continue to be attributed to the same set, including all spaced repetition "
"history. Sets can now also be renamed,\n"
"without changing any other parameters.\n"
"\n"
"- Custom sets can now specify the rating adjustment algorithm. Previously, "
"the custom set specific\n"
"rating was always based on the standard rating method of rating adjustment, "
"where time had no\n"
"impact on rating. You can now choose your custom set rating method from "
"untimed, blitz and mixed.\n"
"\n"
"- A new problem selection type has been added which allows custom sets to "
"use the 'give me problems\n"
"close to my rating' selection method used for rated problems. This uses a "
"bell curve\n"
"problem distribution around your rating (offset by your difficulty level "
"selection). Theoretically, any problem can\n"
"be chosen from the set, but problems closer to the middle of the bell curve "
"are much more likely.\n"
"\n"
"- More direct control over the previous attempts filter is now possible. The "
"'problems I always got wrong', 'Problems\n"
"I have never tried' etc options, have been extended with the possibility of "
"direct control over the attempt numbers. So\n"
"you can now create filters for arbitrary attempt scenarios, such as "
"\"Problem I got wrong more than 4 times and correct\n"
"less than 2 times\". To use this option, go to the [new custom problem sets\n"
"page](https://beta.chesstempo.com/custom-sets/), click on the previous "
"attempts tab, then on the history filter\n"
"selector, choose the 'advanced history filter' option.\n"
"\n"
"# Comment changes\n"
"\n"
"- Comments can now use the markdown formatting language, for more structured "
"comment text,\n"
"such as headings, bold/italic font changes and links. See [this markdown "
"tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for\n"
"an overview of the markdown format.\n"
"- You can reply to a comment instead of adding an entirely new comment. When "
"someone replies to one of your own\n"
"comments, you'll also receive an email notification if you have given "
"Chesstempo permission to send you emails (given\n"
"via the account tab in your preferences).\n"
"\n"
"# Tagging Changes\n"
"\n"
"- To help improve tag consistency, the tag definitions are now much\n"
"easier to access, and tagging a particular tag for the first time (or the "
"first time in a long time), will bring up a\n"
"panel showing the tag definition and examples.\n"
"- The tag voting numbers are available for all tags. Previously these were "
"hidden once a tag\n"
"was given a high level of up-votes, but you can now hover over each tag to "
"see the full up and down vote count.\n"
"- The personal tag management dialog now allows you to rename existing "
"personal tags.\n"
"\n"
"# HTTPS support\n"
"\n"
"- The new site encrypts all communications between the server and your "
"browser, a feature not available on the old\n"
"  site. Note that membership payments have always been encrypted, as they "
"are processed over HTTPS by Paypal and our\n"
"  Bitcoin payment provider.\n"
"\n"
"# What is next?\n"
"\n"
"The rest of the site features need to be converted to the new site, namely\n"
"- Playing\n"
"- Game database\n"
"- Endgames\n"
"- Guess the move\n"
"- Statistics pages\n"
"- Global comment lists\n"
"- Forum\n"
"\n"
"A dark theme for those that prefer the darker style of the old site is also "
"being investigated. While the beta site will\n"
"work on mobile, it is not fully mobile optimised, and for mobile users, we "
"recommend using the old mobile web app for\n"
"now. Once the desktop version of the site is complete, we will be creating a "
"new mobile web app based on the new\n"
" design.\n"
"\n"
"There is still a lot of work to be done, and we'll be targeting some "
"improvements in existing features during the\n"
"conversion. Once the conversion of existing features is complete and we've "
"switched permanently to the new site, we have\n"
"a number of completely new features planned.\n"
"\n"
"As the beta site has required an almost complete rewrite of all server and "
"user interface code, new bugs not noticed\n"
"during closed beta testing are likely. Please report any problems or "
"feedback you have on the\n"
"[forum](http://chesstempo.com/chess-forum), and a big thanks to the closed "
"beta testers who have helped test and tune\n"
"the new site.\n"
"\n"
"A final thanks to all those who have financially supported the site over the "
"years. Your ongoing support via premium\n"
"memberships allows the site to continue to improve and expand.\n"

"\n"
"# Diamond membership\n"
"We have introduced a new diamond membership level. Diamond membership "
"provides a way to offer features that members have requested, but are "
"difficult to offer at gold membership pricing. The first diamond-only "
"feature will be the ability to use multiple CPU threads when using chess "
"engines for position analysis. Currently, each analysis is run on a single "
"CPU thread. Diamond members will be able to run 8 threads at once, either "
"with the same engine for deeper analysis, or across multiple engines to "
"analyse up to 8 different positions at the same time.\n"
"\n"
"The higher priced Diamond membership will help fund the purchase of more "
"engine cluster servers to provide the extra analysis power. More features "
"will be added to Diamond membership in the future as we roll out new "
"features, however Gold and Silver memberships will retain all current "
"features, and will continue to receive at least some of the benefits of new "
"premium features in the future.\n"
"\n"
"To signup for the new diamond membership, or upgrade from silver or gold, "
"please go to the [new membership signup page](https://beta.chesstempo.com/"
"memberships/). Diamond membership is $9/month paid monthly or save $29 and "
"pay $79 for a full year. Both one-time and auto-renewing options are "
"available.\n"
"\n"
"# Group gold membership discounts\n"
"Chesstempo is being used successfully by many schools, chess clubs and "
"coaching groups to improve the performance of their students and members. "
"Gold membership provides many extra benefits , including the ability to "
"group students into a coaching group which can be managed by a coach or "
"group of coaches.\n"
"\n"
"To make it easier for these groups to afford the benefits of Chesstempo gold "
"membership, we are now offering group pricing from as low as $12 per person "

"We've been providing game analysis for all the rated games played on "
"Chesstempo for some time. Up until now, the game\n"
"annotations did a great job of working out where you had gone wrong, and "
"giving '?!', '?' or '??' annotations where\n"
"appropriate. However, no feedback was provided on good moves. It is much "
"easier for an engine to notice when a mistake\n"
"has been made, but harder for it to work out if a move deserves a '!' "
"annotation. A simple approach that gives '!' for\n"
"any move that matches the engine's best move isn't very satisfying, as it "
"would include a large number of obvious moves,\n"
"such as recaptures or reacting to an attacked piece.\n"
"\n"
"We've recently started using more data from the engine to try to add some "
"meaningful '!' annotations based on how engine\n"
"evaluations change as analysis depth increases. While not perfect, we think "
"we have an algorithm that is useful enough\n"
"to start using in our game analysis. Providing '!' annotations that match "
"human ideas on what constitutes a '!' move can\n"
"be challenging. Firstly, not all human annotators agree on when a '!' is "
"appropriate. The same game annotated by two\n"
"different humans can end up with different moves being given '!' markers. "
"The engine approach we are using is also not\n"
"going to identify some typical '!' situations, such as the finding of a "
"sound opening novelty, or a move that is strong\n"
"positionally, without having any tactical consequences in the foreseeable "
"future.\n"
"\n"
"So how does it perform in practice? During development we tested the "
"annotator by running it over a collection of just\n"
"under 200 human annotated games, containing nearly 14000 moves. Just over "
"900 of those were given '!' or '!!' marks by\n"
"the human annotators. The current version of the annotator managed to find "
"about 20%\n"
"of the human annotated good moves. When considering the number of different "
"reasons for a '!' or '!!' annotation, we\n"
"felt this was a reasonable outcome given our approach was mainly focused on "
"finding tactically significant moves, so was\n"
"unlikely to find positional or opening novelty '!' human annotations.\n"
"\n"
"We also limited our annotator to only consider '!' annotations on moves that "
"were considered best by the engine. This\n"
"excluded marking moves that might have been good, but had other good moves "
"available, or moves that the engine didn't\n"
"reach enough depth to see as the best move. Some of the annotations by the "
"humans were also done in the pre-computer\n"
"era, so it is likely some human '!' were not actually deserving of the "
"marker. If we look at only human marked good\n"
"moves the engine considered to be the top move in the position, then our "
"agreement with human annotators goes up to\n"
"35%. If we consider only moves given '!!' annotations, we do even better, as "
"these are often the types of moves that are\n"
"tactically significant, which are the types of moves our approach is "
"targeting. When looking at the moves that were the\n"
"engine top move, we get a 65% success rate at marking human '!!' moves as "
"good. Note that we don't try to differentiate\n"
"'!' and '!!' in our own annotations, so any move considered good will get a "
"'!' at most. We experimented with\n"
"differentiating '!' and '!!', but felt the accuracy of the differentiation "
"wasn't worth it.\n"
"\n"
"Another important metric in a good move annotator is how many moves it gives "
"a '!' that didn't deserve it. It is not\n"
"very useful if you are only hitting about 20% of human annotated '!' moves "
"if you are also annotating 20% of all moves\n"
"with '!' markers. With current settings we end up marking just under 4% of "
"all moves with '!' that were not given '!' by\n"
"the human annotator. Given some of these moves are probably deserving of a "
"'!', but were missed by the human annotator,\n"
"we feel this is an acceptable false positive rate. The typical type of "
"incorrect false positive is where a move is\n"
"obviously the best move from a human point of view, and doesn't require much "
"calculation to identify the move as best,\n"
"but the engine notices the move may also win some material much further down "
"the track.  Note that all the test games\n"
"are master games, and probably all classical time controls. Testing the "
"annotator on sub-master games produces a lot\n"
"less '!' annotations. Using 200 blitz games from a 1600 rated player "
"produced only 1.4% '!' annotations, given some of\n"
"these were probably legitimately '!' moves, that is a very low false "
"positive rate. It also means if you are an\n"
"average player you shouldn't be expecting to see '!' moves every game.\n"
"\n"
"Ideally we'd have liked to be able to give out more '!' moves to lower rated "
"players, but because simple forcing\n"
"tactics that might require 2 or 3 ply calculation for a human are often seen "
"by the engine at depth 1 due to move\n"
"extensions, these simple tactics - while good from the point of view of the "
"rating of the player -  are unlikely to be considered good by the\n"
"annotator. \n"
"\n"
"Importantly, it is very rare for the annotator to give a '!' move to a move "
"that the human annotator actually considered\n"
"bad. In our current test games, we had 5 moves marked by humans as blunders "
"(??), 150 as mistakes (?), 125 as dubious\n"
"(?!), and 105 as speculative (!?). Of all those moves, only one dubious (?!) "
"move was marked as good by the computer\n"
"annotator.  \n"
"\n"
"You can see the annotator in action on our [playing server](https://beta."
"chesstempo.com/play-chess-online/).  Play a\n"
"rated game (you'll need to be logged into an account, but no need for "
"premium membership), after the game is over the\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"You don't need a premium membership to purchase a book, and some  premium "
"features are made available for free to non-paying members when training "

"each loop through the contents - a feature usually only available to premium "
"members. \n"
"\n"
"Gold and Diamond members can create their own book material, allowing "
"functionality such as bringing in their own tactics problems for training on "
"Chesstempo and making use of our extensive custom set features These include "
"spaced repetition, looping sets, drilling of past mistakes etc. Coaches can "
"assign books they have created to their students, allowing lessons with "
"specific training content to be shared with each student. \n"
"\n"
"We are starting out with a small number of books, but plan to grow the "
"number of available offerings quickly. Books we currently have available for "

"We've made a very significant update to the stats available on the site. "
"There are many updates to existing stats, and a very large number of new "
"stats now available, along with a number of important new features. A new "
"dashboard style view is provided where individual stats panels can now be "
"chosen by the user, and ordered and sized according to the user's needs.\n"
"\n"
"Most panels now come with extensive filtering features, including time "
"range, and feature specific filters such as solve time, or game metrics such "
"as average engine deviations. Panels can be cloned and saved, along with "
"their filters, so for example you can create a persistent game history panel "
"just to show your best (or worst) games based on engine evaluation, or a "
"problem history list showing only the problem you got wrong most recently, "
"and have those available as permanent stats panels.\n"
"\n"
"Game history and problem history lists include summary data across all your "
"available history , with a wide number of metrics tracked. Game history "
"summary data provides an aggregated view of some of the data extracted from "
"our extensive cheat detection metrics, such as game phase performance, move "
"timings, piece move specific stats, and a new skill score derived from "
"engine evaluations. By using filters, summary data can be compared against "
"different subsets of your history. So you can for example compare how your "
"summary data looks this year, compared to last year, or how your accuracy "
"differs in bullet vs blitz or how castling or not castling impacts "
"performance in key metrics, with the differences between the summary metrics "
"for each subsequent filtering shown.\n"
"\n"
"For example, here is a summary of the last 500 bullet and blitz games for a "
"player (the bullet figures on the left, the blitz figures on the right, with "
"the difference shown in the third column). \n"
"       ![Bullet vs Blitz](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/game-"
"summary-comparison.webp) \n"
"       \n"
"       This is a sample of the stats, many more are available than shown in "
"this screenshot.\n"
"\n"
"A new benchmarking feature allows you to compare not just between different "
"views of your own data, but against data summarised from recent games or "
"problem solving history of all users in rating ranges of your choice. So for "
"example if you are rated 1500, you can compare your playing or solving "
"metrics against players rated 2000-2100 to see how you differ on the "
"available metrics.  Comparing to your own rating range can also be useful, "
"for example if your skill level is high in the opening but low in the "
"endgame when compared to players at your own level, it may indicate more "
"training time should be spent on endgames. Benchmarking can also compare "
"groups, so you can also see how all 1500-1600 players compare to say "
"2100-2200 players for example. In the screenshot below you can see a subset "
"of the summary stats shown comparing recent blitz games from 1500-1600 "
"players against 2100-2200 players:\n"
"       ![Benchmarking 1500-1600 vs 2100-2200](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/"
"images/stats/game-benchmark-comparison.webp) \n"
"\n"
"Filters also operate on the benchmark comparisons, so you can also benchmark "
"for specific conditions such as benchmarking only games where queen side "
"castling occurred, or tactics where you took more than a specific amount of "
"time. An interesting use of filters is to compare won games (or correct "
"tactics) with lost games (or failed tactics) and see what the summary stats "
"differences are between the two groups of data. If for example you get your "
"queen out earlier in the lost games than the won games, this might be a hint "
"that you need to be more careful when you develop your queen. This type of "
"comparison can be done both with your own games, or between benchmark groups "
"(for example do 1500-1600 rated players exhibit any differences in piece "
"move patterns between their won games and lost games). \n"
"\n"
"Note that when using these type comparisons in game history, restricting the "
"data to a particular time controls (i.e rating types) might produce more "
"interesting results as playing patterns can differ greatly between time "
"controls, and patterns impacting performance differences might be more "
"obvious when looking at a particular time control rather than averaging "
"across all time controls. Similarly, comparing won and lost games might be "
"more interesting when also using an opponent rating range, as part of the "
"differences between won and lost games will be driven by what your opponent "
"allowed you to do, and keeping opponent ratings in the same range as your "
"own (or the benchmark group) rating when comparing may make for more "
"interesting comparisons by factoring out the impact of opponent's with "
"superior strength on the metrics. \n"
"\n"
"## Updates to existing stats\n"
"\n"
"Before going into detail on the new stats available, some updates to "
"existing stats not already covered include:\n"
" - Rating/percentile charts\n"
"       ![Tactics rating graph](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/"
"tactics-rating-graph.webp)\n"
"       ![Tactics percentile](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/tactics-"
"percentile.webp)\n"
" \n"
"   - Rating history graphs no longer use sampled data, and so can be zoomed "
"into to see every rating point. \n"
"   - Rating and percentile rank graphs have options for the x-axis to be "
"based on problem attempt number like the old stats pages, or time. Time is "
"now the default and when selected rating graphs include a regression line "
"showing the trend of the rating or percentile rank movement. \n"
"   - Convenient date selection functionality to zoom into particular time "
"regions.\n"
"\n"
" - The \"candlestick\" daily rating fluctuations graphs\n"
"     ![Tactics Candlestick](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/tactics-"
"candlestick.webp)\n"
" \n"
"   - New setting to allow showing fluctuations over different time periods "
"than a day. You can now see daily, weekly, monthly or yearly fluctuations to "
"track changes from a larger time interval than just a single day.\n"
"   - Data can also be seen over arbitrary time periods (only the last month "
"was available on the old site's version). Infinite zoom is available to zoom "
"into any time period over your solving history.\n"
"   - Added moving average line to chart.\n"
"   - Allow filtering the included data by several metrics. \n"
"   - Extended the tooltip data available for each candlestick bar , adding "
"number done, average problem rating (broken down into average rating of "
"correct and incorrect problems), accuracy, performance rating, average time "
"taken and total time taken. These can be particularly useful when looking at "
"longer time periods, and provide an easy way of seeing how performance has "
"changed month to month or year to year.\n"
"   \n"
" - The monthly solving calendar\n"
" \n"
"   - Mouseover on month title summarising solving for the current month by "
"problem set.\n"
"   - Mouseover on daily solving stats breaks down all sets instead of "
"lumping all custom set solving into 'Unrated'.\n"
"   - Days in month now background coloured based on the amount of activity "
"on that day (i.e the monthly solving calendar view is now also a heatmap "
"based on activity).\n"
"\n"
"     ![Monthly calendar view](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/"
"monthly-calendar.webp)\n"
"\n"
" - Problem history\n"
" \n"
"   - Motif tags column added to problem history\n"
"   - Improved tooltips showing board for each problem in history, with "
"tooltip boards now showing animated pre-move if the problem had one.\n"
"  \n"
"\n"
" - Endgame/Tactics set performance table\n"
"     ![Tactics set performance table](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/"
"stats/tactics-set-performance-table.webp)\n"
" \n"
"   - Column sorting available.\n"
"   - 'Train' button to jump into training for each set listed.\n"
"   - Filterable.\n"
"\n"
" - Endgame type performance table\n"
" \n"
"   - Made endgame type name more readable, i.e 'Q vs. R' instead of 'QKRK'\n"
"   - Column sorting available.\n"
"   - Endgame benchmark rating type now included (the old site only had "
"Theory and practice mode performance numbers).\n"
"   - Added 'Other' performance to track custom set endgame type "
"performance.\n"
"\n"
" - Rated tactics mate length performance table\n"
"      ![Tactics mate length table](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/"
"tactics-mate-length.webp)\n"
"      \n"
"   - Column sorting available.\n"
"   - Added mixed mode performance (previously only showing blitz/standard).\n"
"\n"
" - Motif performance table\n"
" \n"
"   - Added 'Other' performance rating and total done columns to cover custom "
"set motif performance. \n"
"   - Sorting the motif table by performance ratings is a good way of seeing "
"the motifs you are performing poor only, for example here is the table "
"sorted by performance in each motif in standard mode:\n"
"      ![Tactics motif performance sorted by standard mode performance rating]"
"(https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/tactics-motif-sorted-by-std-perf."
"webp) \n"
"\n"
" - FIDE estimations\n"
" \n"
"   ![FIDE estimate](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/tactics-rating-"
"summary.webp)\n"
"   - Estimates are now available for all of the tactics and endgame rating "
"modes i.e Standard/Blitz/Mixed for tactics and Benchmark/Theory/Practice for "
"endgames. Mixed/Benchmark/Theory/Practice mode have less available data for "
"the statistics to extract patterns from so are likely to be slightly less "
"accurate than the Standard and Blitz mode estimates, but we also believe the "
"new Blitz/Standard estimates are likely to be somewhat more accurate than "
"the old estimates. \n"
"\n"
"## New Panels\n"
"\n"
"- Yearly attempts calendar\n"
"       ![Yearly solving attempts calendar](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/"
"stats/yearly-calendar.webp)\n"

"\n"
"     - Shows the problems that are coming due over the selected time period. "
"Selecting 'Week' as the time period shows how many items are due each day in "
"the next 7 days. 'Month' shows items due each day for the next 30 days, "
"'Year' shows items due by months, and \"All years\" shows items due by year. "
"You need to select the problem set you want to view, if you'd like to be "

" - Tactics/Endgame Attempt Repeats\n"
"    - A table showing how performance changes over the number of repeats for "
"a problem, for example the first row shows results for problems that had a "
"single attempt, the second row problems that were attempted twice, the third "
"row problems attempted three times etc. Performance rating, accuracy, "

"times of day impact your solving performance. Tracks attempt number, "
"performance rating, accuracy and time spent based on hour of day.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Many of the above graphs that offer visualisations of the regular blitz/"
"standard/mixed/benchmark/theory/practice rating types can also be used to "
"visualise custom set attempts by clicking on the header, clicking the 'Copy' "
"action. Then on the newly created panel , select the 'Show Filters' action "
"and add a 'problem set' filter. It is suggested you then rename the panel to "
"something reflecting the problem set you've chosen to avoid confusion with "
"the original panel.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
" - New Playing related panels\n"
"    - Previously , the stats page did not have playing related stats, and "
"this need was partly covered by the rating graphs, game history and opening "
"summary data available on the 'my chess games' view in the game database. "
"We've now added several playing related stats to the new stats page. This "
"includes new versions of some of the game database 'my chess games' views. "
"Note that the playing stats are not intended to be a complete replacement "
"for the 'my chess games' view, and a new game database replacing the old "
"site version will be created to cover some features that the stats page "
"playing stats are not intended to cover.\n"
"   - Completely new playing stats not currently available on the old 'my "
"games view' includes:\n"
"      - Openings Played Sunburst\n"
"         - Sunburst visualisation of the initial opening moves played in "
"Chesstempo games.\n"
"            ![openings played  sunburst](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/"
"stats/sunburst.webp)\n"
"        \n"
"         - As well as a number of filters for which games' moves are "
"included in the visualisations, several settings are available (click on the "
"panel header and choose 'settings'):\n"

"               - Win rate (the win rate in your games from the position "
"after the move).\n"
"           The latter two can be very useful to highlight parts of your "
"repertoire that are performing poorly, or are considered unwise by "
"stockfish. \n"
"         - Typically, if you've played a large number of games, not all the "
"moves can be shown at once, click on a move in the visualisation to drill "
"down into that branch. Clicking on the board in the middle will jump back "
"one move, double click the board to jump all the way back to the start "
"position.\n"
"         - Opening names, win rates and engine evals (where available) are "
"shown at the bottom of the panel.\n"

"      - The game history table, with a number of improvements mentioned "
"above such as summary stats, and benchmarking. Also added tooltips for both "
"the end of game position (hover over the result column) and the opening "
"position (hover over the opening name). History is also downloadable in a "

"    future.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"New Guess the move stats\n"
"\n"
" - GTM moves heatmap\n"
"   - Similar to the Problem mistakes heatmap, but for all GTM moves played, "
"and with different metrics for colouring. The choices being number of moves, "
"average move rating (i.e the average difficulty of the moves) and the "
"average move score received. You can choose to view the heatmap for either "
"your move or the master move from the games, and comparing both may be "
"useful (copy the heatmap panel and set one to master and one to 'our moves' "
"if you'd like to see them side by side).\n"
"   - For most people, the majority of moves will get a good move score, "
"especially in the opening, so if you want to look at bad moves on the "
"heatmap, you might want to filter by scores under 10, here is an example GTM "
"move heatmap using average move scores as the heatmap colouring metric:\n"
"\n"
"    ![GTM heatmap](https://c1b.chesstempo.com/images/stats/gtm-moves-heatmap."

"  \n"
" - GTM rating/match type distribution\n"
"    - Stacked bar graph showing the number of moves broken down into master/"
"engine/opening/unmatched status for different rating ranges.  Note for "
"counting a move as either master/engine/opening/unmatched , a hierarchy is "
"used such that if a move matches multiple types it will be attributed to the "
"highest member of the hierarchy, with the highest to lowest being master/"
"engine/opening. So if a move was both best engine and best master move, it "
"will be counted as a master move match, if it was both an opening theory "
"match and an engine match, but not a master move match it will be counted as "
"an engine match. Any move matching none of the three types will be counted "
"as 'unmatched'.\n"

"\n"
"Firstly, if you had access to a particular stats view on the old site, then "

"\n"
"We've also extended availability of several features previously only "
"available to premium members to free members, namely:\n"

"- Previous Guess the move stats views that were premium only are now "
"available to free users. Free members only have limited access to Guess the "
"move, however some paid books make extensive use of the GTM feature, and "
"we'd like the GTM stats to be as useful as possible for free members who "
"have purchased books, so we've made most of the GTM views available for free "
"(only the GTM heatmap remains premium-only).\n"
"- Mistake move column on problem history view.\n"

"Stockfish 12 is the first official version of Stockfish to feature a neural "

"A major update to both the Android and iOS mobile apps has been released. "
"Opening training is now available within the app. All features from the "
"desktop opening trainer are supported, although the mobile version is "
"optimised for training mode, and it is probably more efficient to edit your "
"repertoire on the larger desktop version. We've also updated the mobile UI , "
"with many improvements. Accessibility is also improved in several areas, "
"including the introduction of  a new board setting to allow FIDE and NATO "
"format for column names in move lists and accessible board descriptions, "
"improving screen reader readability. On iOS, we've worked around a VoiceOver "
"bug which prevented text move entry from working correctly.\n"
"\n"
"The desktop beta site has also received a major refresh in preparation for "
"moving to the beta site as the default version of Chesstempo early next "
"year. While most of the changes are cosmetic or non-visible server changes "
"(we moved to a more modern implementation of Material design, and updated a "
"large portion of our beta infrastructure), there are several functionality "
"improvements including:\n"
"- Ability to disable lines during opening training, while still keeping them "
"in the repertoire. You can also choose to disable all alternative lines of "
"your colour when importing a repertoire from PGN. Right click (or hold press "
"on Mobile) on a move in the opening tree to access the enable/disable "
"option.\n"
"- Branches of an opening repertoire can be copied to other repertoires "
"(again right click on the start of the branch to copy in the opening tree to "
"access the copy option).\n"
"- PGN export of opening repertoires is now more Chessbase compatible.\n"
"- Easier to find set change button in tactics, and the tactics colour to "
"play knight icon from the old site has been brought back.\n"
"- Lots of page load speed optimisations and small tweaks and bug fixes."

"- Internet Explorer will no longer be supported. We strongly recommend you "

"  - Ability to find positions in the opening tree by move sequence or "
"position.\n"
"  - Comments on each move can be viewed directly on the move list (see "
"comment toggle button under the move list).\n"
"  - Repertoire shortcuts can now be placed in sub-folders under each "
"repertoire (choose a folder name when creating the shortcut).\n"
"  - Repertoire tree now shows extended learning status for each repertoire, "
"repertoire folder and shortcut, making it easier to see which parts of your "

"- We've started using the default system font on each platform instead of "
"the custom font we were previously using. This will speed up page loads and "

"A replacement for the old endgame trainer is now available, and can be "

"\n"
"The new trainer introduces two major changes:\n"
"1. The introduction of a new training mode, called \"Benchmark\" mode which "
"uses the average number of moves made by all users on successful solutions "
"rather than the fastest path to mate to calculate rating adjustments. Once "
"ratings have settled, this should provide a more forgiving mode, where "
"sensible moves that end up taking more moves to mate receive more generous "
"rating adjustments than in the existing Theory and Practice modes.\n"
"2.  6 and 7 piece endgames are now available on top of the 3, 4 and 5 piece "
"endgames available in the old trainer. 6 piece endgames are available in "
"Benchmark, Theory and Practice modes. The 7 piece endgames are only "
"available in Benchmark mode, as they only have win/draw/loss information, "
"and don't have depth to mate numbers which are required to score the Theory "
"and Practice mode problems. To provide challenging opponent responses "
"without depth to mate information, stockfish will be used to help choose "
"opponent moves in many 7 piece endgame situations. \n"
"\n"
"Other improvements over the old version include endgame solving session "
"stats, the ability to easily replay the problem after solving, and access to "
"distraction free mode when solving in full screen.\n"
"\n"
"The new trainer has the same usage quotas as the old trainer, with 2 "
"problems per day for free members, 20 per day for silver members, and "
"unlimited solving for gold and diamond members.\n"
"\n"
"It will take a few days for ratings on the new endgames to stabilise and for "
"average solution lengths for benchmark moves to reach stability, and to help "
"accelerate this, Benchmark mode will replace Theory mode as the new default "
"endgame rating type.\n"

"\n"
" With this update, Stockfish 16.1 will be used in the following areas on the "
"site:\n"
"\n"
" - Our play online game analysis which analyses every rated game\n"
"  played on the site. This allows us to not only provide post-game\n"
"  analysis to the players, but also provides an excellent source of\n"
"  data for our cheat detection system which checks all rated games for "
"potential cheating.\n"
"  Our cloud infrastructure allows\n"
"  us to spread the analysis out over the hundreds of engines running\n"
"  in our cluster,  running the analysis in parallel. This means we are\n"
"  able to return full game analysis in under 10 seconds in most\n"
"  situations, and at an analysis depth that provides a great analysis\n"
"  quality/wait time tradeoff.  Our post-game cluster analysis is\n"
"  available to all players, including those without premium\n"
"  membership. You can play games and see the post game analysis in\n"
"  action on our [play online page](https://chesstempo.com/play-chess-"
"online/)\n"
"  \n"
" - Extraction of tactical positions from your games. This happens as\n"
" part of the post game analysis, with tactical positions from the game\n"
" added to your set of 'my game' problems. For gold members or\n"
" above these can be solved against at any time from the tactics solving\n"
" page.\n"
"\n"
" - Play position vs computer when launched from the analysis panel.\n"
" \n"
" - Arbitrary position multi variation analysis for premium "
"members,                                                     \n"
"   including the use of up to 8 CPU threads per engine for "

"Running the engines on our servers instead of your own device provides\n"
"a significant advantage for mobile users where the cloud engines will\n"
"usually be running on much more powerful hardware than the mobile\n"
"device. Running on our own servers also allows us to run the full\n"
"sized neural networks without needing to worry about memory issues\n"
"that can occur on some devices with browser run engines with larger neural "

"Our [Guess The Move training tool](https://chesstempo.com/guess-the-move/) "
"is now available on the new site. \n"
"\n"
"[Guess The Move](https://chesstempo.com/guess-the-move/) is a fun chess "
"training tool that allows you to play through master games, taking the side "
"of one of the players, and trying to guess the best move as you go. You get "
"scored on how well you play compared to the master's original moves, and "
"receive a Guess The Move rating so you can track your progress.\n"
"\n"
"Most of the features remain the same as the old version, with the main "
"changes for this release being:\n"
"- Over 270 chess games added to the available games, bringing the total to "
"just over 770 games.\n"
"- Tactics tags can now be applied to GTM positions where previously only "
"positional tags were available. To try to deal with the complexity of having "
"all the tactical and positional tags available, we've introduced a tag "
"folder hierarchy to help avoid an overwhelmingly large top level tag list.\n"
"- Scoring for some situations has been tuned, mostly where very winning "
"moves that were not the master move were played. Previously, these could be "
"quite harshly dealt with in the scoring system, and we are now a bit more "
"lenient in these cases.\n"
"\n"
"This is the last of the training tools that required converting from the old "
"site, and we'll be increasingly focused on new and improved training "

"The [opening trainer](https://chesstempo.com/opening-training/) has a number "

"-  Two new learning mode alternatives:\n"
"   1. Review in order:  Review all moves in your repertoire in order. Great "
"for pre-tournament review.\n"
"   2. Least recent first: Review items not seen for a long time first. "
"Useful if you feel spaced repetition is pushing items too far into the "
"future.\n"
"- Started recording incorrect moves made, and providing a view of your "
"previous mistakes for each move (only recording while training on desktop "
"for now).\n"
"- Clustering currently due items by variation. Previously, due items were "
"sorted by due date, which is still available as an option. However by "
"default we now sort due items by variation, which reduces the amount of "
"jumping around required while going over your currently due items.\n"
"- When training a sub-branch, you can optionally choose to consider lead up "
"moves that lead to the branch point for training.\n"
"- A new comments panel to make it easier see your own comments on a position "
"(either those made within the system, or those imported from PGN). \n"
"- Ability to draw arrows (right click and drag) and square highlights (right "
"click) on the training board. Hit the 's' key after drawing, to permanently "
"save any arrows or squares to your repertoire data. \n"
"- Option to show the candidate moves in the current position as board arrows "
"while not training (mainline move purple, other candidate moves grey).\n"
"- Option to show the most popular move according to the opening explorer as "
"an orange arrow while not training.\n"

"\n"
"Over 10 years ago, Chesstempo helped pioneer the ability to solve online "
"tactics problems broken down into specific motifs such as Pin, Fork and "
"Discovered attack. This proved to be a popular feature with our premium "
"users, and in order to continue to provide a high quality service to our non-"
"paying users, we've decided to provide basic motif matching free to all "
"users.\n"
"\n"
"Non-paying users will now see a 'Themes and Motifs'  folder available in the "
"change set panel on the tactics training page, allowing them to choose "
"amongst all the motif tags we currently have available.\n"
"\n"
"We hope our premium members - who have very generously supported the site "
"over the years - will continue to find reasons to continue that financial "
"support via our extensive range of features only available to premium "
"members, such as:\n"
"- Spaced repetition training.\n"
"- Sophisticated custom sets including advanced motif matching (e.g Pin AND "
"discovered attack BUT NOT Fork).\n"
"- Extended statistics and graphs.\n"
"- Powerful cloud engine access.\n"
"- Personal problem sets based on tactics extracted from the games you've "
"played on Chesstempo.\n"
"- Advanced mistake based filtering (e.g problems you've got wrong at least "
"once, and correct less than 3 times).\n"
"- Creation of custom motif tags, allowing you to build your own "
"categorisation and targeted solving system.\n"
"- Sorted sets, allowing you to loop through a set of problems multiple "
"times. \n"
"- View common mistakes made by others in problems.\n"
"- Ability to download all problem attempt data in Excel format.\n"
"- Unlimited endgame and guess the move training.\n"
"- Increased position quota for the opening trainer.\n"
"- Many other advanced features. See the [full list of membership features]"

"A major upgrade to the tactical motif tagging system has been released..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A major upgrade to the tactical motif tagging system has been released. The "
"new system introduces the following changes:\n"
"- More than double the number of tactical motifs, adding 79 new motifs, "
"which extends the number of tactical motifs to 141. Some of these are more "
"specific versions of existing motifs, others are completely new, and often "
"unique to Chesstempo, with many suggestions on new tags from our users now "
"implemented.\n"
"- Allowing all the positional motifs previously only available for tagging "
"in [Guess the Move games](https://chesstempo.com/guess-the-move/)  to be "
"applied to tactical problems where applicable. Together with the new  "
"tactical motifs, this brings the total number of tags to 200.\n"
"- Organising tags into a tree structure, instead of a single list in order "
"to more easily manage the complexity of the new tagging system.\n"
"- Introduction of a tag modifier system that provide a way of specifying "
"attributes on a tag to allow more specific versions of tags without "
"introducing hundreds of new tags. For example marking a tactic as involving "
"check, or the piece involved in executing the tactic, allowing tags like "
"Fork[Knight,Check] and Fork[Pawn] to differentiate a knight fork with check "
"from a Fork initiated by a pawn without check. Custom sets have been updated "
"to allow premium members to search for these more specific forms.\n"
"\n"
"Premium members can already create their own custom sets to target the new "
"tags, but it will be a few weeks before problems start to gather a "
"substantial volume of votes on the new tags. Once this has happened we will "
"extend the pre-canned motif specific sets to provide all users with basic "
"motif specific solving with the new motifs.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage everyone to read the [new tactical motif descriptions page]"
"(https://chesstempo.com/tactical-motifs) before trying to tag with the new "
"tags. The [tagging guidelines](https://chesstempo.com/tagging-guidelines) "
"have also been updated to cover the best ways of using the new tag modifiers "
"feature.\n"
"\n"
"The new system has involved a lot of thought and effort from many users, "
"including user suggestions going back for several years, and we'd like to "
"thank all those who have contributed suggestions and testing time.  \n"
"\n"
"Special thanks goes to Alvaro Frota, who has provided mountains of feedback, "
"and made numerous improvement suggestions . The richness of the tagging "
"system and attention to detail in the definitions owe much to his "

"com/chess-books/endgames-made-easy/book/2570) by [**FM Bill Jordan**]"
"(https://chesstempo.com/chess-books/fm-bill-jordan/publisher/2190257) is now "
"available on Chesstempo for $19.95 USD.\n"
"\n"
"In recent decades, the landscape of endgame literature has\n"
"predominantly leaned towards advanced materials, featuring numerous\n"
"exceptional books catering to expert-level players. These resources\n"
"are undoubtedly valuable, yet they often presuppose a solid foundation\n"
"in endgame principles, something one might reasonably anticipate from\n"
"a player boasting a 2000 ELO rating. Average club players typically\n"
"have major gaps in their basic endgame knowledge.\n"
"\n"
"This book is designed to help fill the gap. For the sake of\n"
"completeness, some very basic knowledge is included, so that the book\n"
"will be useful for novices as well as club players.\n"
"\n"
"To excel in endgame play, one need not burden themselves with an\n"
"encyclopedic knowledge of thousands of positions. Instead, a solid\n"
"grasp of fundamental principles, coupled with the ability to calculate\n"
"effectively, can pave the path to strong endgame play.\n"
"\n"
"This book explores the essential endgame strategies, making it\n"
"accessible and beneficial for players of up to average club level.\n"
"Critical endgame concepts, such as opposition and zugzwang are\n"
"introduced, equipping the reader with invaluable tools for navigating\n"
"many endgame scenarios. 200 endgame puzzles are included, meticulously\n"
"selected to both challenge and fortify one’s understanding of key\n"
"endgame techniques.\n"
"\n"
"Journeying through the book and diligently tackling its exercises will\n"
"empower the reader with an understanding of a diverse range of essential\n"
"endgames. The positions presented are similar to those you will\n"
"encounter in your actual games, and vary across a wide range of difficulty.\n"
"\n"
"The book's chapters include:\n"
"\n"
"- Pieces versus Lone King\n"
"- Passed Pawns\n"
"- Pawns versus Lone King\n"
"- Pawn Endings with One or Two Pawns Each\n"
"- Pawn Endings with more Pawns\n"
"- Knights\n"
"- Bishops\n"
"- Rooks\n"
"- Queens\n"
"- Pieces versus Pieces\n"
"- Other Endings\n"
"\n"
"With this structured approach, our aim is to empower players to\n"
"enhance their endgame prowess and confidently navigate this critical\n"
"phase of chess.\n"
"\n"
"Those who purchase the e-book can read through the book in reading mode, "
"move through the material in interactive study mode, or drill the material "
"via several methods, including spaced repetition or by looping through the "
"material multiple times until mastered. The spaced repetition and looping "
"sets are available to all members who have purchased the book, and do not "
"require a premium membership.\n"

"Jordan**](https://chesstempo.com/chess-books/fm-bill-jordan/"
"publisher/2190257) is now accessible on Chesstempo for $14.95 USD.\n"
"\n"
"The ability to look ahead is a fundamental skill in the world of chess, "
"strongly correlated with overall chess proficiency. Tigran Petrosian, a "
"world chess champion, once said the person who is the best in the world at "
"\"I go there, he goes there, I go there etc.\" is the best player in the "
"world.\n"
"\n"
"Looking ahead in chess requires the cultivation of visual memory, a skill "
"honed through diligent practice.\n"
"\n"
"Look Ahead! has been expertly crafted to enhance your visualisation skills, "
"making the process of seeing ahead as easy as possible.\n"
"\n"
"This book caters primarily to beginners and players up to a rating of 1400, "
"systematically guiding you towards the capacity to visualize up to four "
"moves ahead.\n"
"\n"
"This book uses variations which culminate in checkmate, requiring you to "
"correctly visualise if a potential position is mate. For instance, you "
"wouldn’t want to sacrifice your Queen only to discover that there is an "
"escape from what you thought was a checkmate. In each position, visualise "
"the final mate before playing your move or moves.\n"
"\n"
"In the first chapter of mate in 1 puzzles your aim is to find the mating "
"move. When you have found a move, it is recommended that you carefully "
"visualise the consequences of that move. The same puzzles are repeated in "
"each chapter, but one move deeper each time. Having familiarized yourself "
"with the variations in earlier chapters should make solving the longer "
"sequences more manageable. By visualizing the sequence of moves to be played "
"and the ultimate board position, you will significantly enhance your chess "
"visual memory. With practice, you will get faster and faster at seeing "
"ahead, and find yourself blitzing out mates in your games.\n"
"\n"
"Puzzles are extracted from games involving many famous players with numerous "
"beautiful checkmates included. In some cases there are anecdotes concerning "
"the players involved based on interactions with the author himself.\n"
"\n"
"- Chapter 1 consists of 200 mates in one, some easier than others.\n"
"- Chapter 2 has 200 mates in two, building on the mates in one.\n"
"- Chapter 3 has 200 mates in three, building on the mates in two.\n"
"- Chapter 4 has the complete 200 mates in four.\n"
"\n"
"Those who purchase the e-book can read through the book in reading mode, "
"move through the material in interactive study mode, or drill the material "
"via several methods, including spaced repetition or by looping through the "
"material multiple times until mastered. The spaced repetition and looping "

"The first part of the book has several chapters involving different ways of "
"attacking the king during the opening, and a chapter on opening tactics not "

"reinforces the material introduced in the first section using puzzles from "
"real game positions to test your understanding.\n"
"\n"
"Those who purchase the book can read through it in reading mode, move "

"\n"
"This is the fourth book in Bill's 'Look Ahead' series, featuring longer "
"sequences with the difficulty level extended to 7 moves, as opposed to 4, 5 "
"and 6 moves in the first three books. \n"
"\n"
"The ability to look ahead is a fundamental skill in the world of chess, "
"strongly correlated with overall chess proficiency. Tigran Petrosian, a "

"Looking ahead in chess requires the cultivation of visual memory, a skill "
"honed through diligent practice.\n"
"\n"
"Look Ahead! has been expertly crafted to enhance your visualisation skills, "

"\n"
"This book caters primarily to beginners and players up to a rating of 1700, "
"systematically guiding you towards the capacity to visualize up to seven "
"moves ahead.\n"
"\n"
"This book uses variations which culminate in checkmate, requiring you to "
"correctly visualise if a potential position is mate. For instance, you "
"wouldn’t want to sacrifice your Queen only to discover that there is an "
"escape from what you thought was a checkmate. In each position, visualise "
"the final mate before playing your move or moves.\n"
"\n"
"In the first chapter of mate in 1 puzzles your aim is to find the mating "
"move. When you have found a move, it is recommended that you carefully "
"visualise the consequences of that move. The same puzzles are repeated in "
"each chapter, but one move deeper each time. Having familiarized yourself "
"with the variations in earlier chapters should make solving the longer "
"sequences more manageable. By visualizing the sequence of moves to be played "
"and the ultimate board position, you will significantly enhance your chess "
"visual memory. With practice, you will get faster and faster at seeing "
"ahead, and find yourself blitzing out mates in your games.\n"
"\n"
"Puzzles are extracted from games involving many famous players with numerous "

"publisher/2190257) is now available on Chesstempo for $14.95 USD.\n"
"\n"
"This is the second book in Bill's **Look Ahead** series, extending the "
"difficulty of the longer sequences from 4 to 5 moves.\n"
"\n"
"The ability to look ahead is a fundamental skill in the world of chess, "
"strongly correlated with overall chess proficiency. Tigran Petrosian, a "
"world chess champion, once said the person who is the best in the world at "
"\"I go there, he goes there, I go there etc.\" is the best player in the "
"world.\n"
"\n"
"Looking ahead in chess requires the cultivation of visual memory, a skill "
"honed through diligent practice.\n"
"\n"
"Look Ahead! has been expertly crafted to enhance your visualisation skills, "
"making the process of seeing ahead as easy as possible.\n"
"\n"
"This book caters primarily to beginners and players up to a rating of 1500, "
"systematically guiding you towards the capacity to visualize up to five "
"moves ahead.\n"
"\n"
"This book uses variations which culminate in checkmate, requiring you to "
"correctly visualise if a potential position is mate. For instance, you "
"wouldn’t want to sacrifice your Queen only to discover that there is an "
"escape from what you thought was a checkmate. In each position, visualise "
"the final mate before playing your move or moves.\n"
"\n"
"In the first chapter of mate in 1 puzzles your aim is to find the mating "
"move. When you have found a move, it is recommended that you carefully "
"visualise the consequences of that move. The same puzzles are repeated in "
"each chapter, but one move deeper each time. Having familiarized yourself "
"with the variations in earlier chapters should make solving the longer "
"sequences more manageable. By visualizing the sequence of moves to be played "
"and the ultimate board position, you will significantly enhance your chess "
"visual memory. With practice, you will get faster and faster at seeing "
"ahead, and find yourself blitzing out mates in your games.\n"
"\n"
"Puzzles are extracted from games involving many famous players with numerous "
"beautiful checkmates included. In some cases there are anecdotes concerning "
"the players involved based on interactions with the author himself.\n"
"\n"
"- Chapter 1 consists of 200 mates in one, some easier than others.\n"
"- Chapter 2 has 200 mates in two, building on the mates in one.\n"
"- Chapter 3 has 200 mates in three, building on the mates in two.\n"
"- Chapter 4 has 200 mates in four, building on the mates in three.\n"
"- Chapter 5 has the complete 200 mates in five.\n"

"Chess Tempo uses three factors to determine the time control. The start "

"time on the clock, the increment time is the time added to the clock after "
"each move, and maximum time is the maximum time above which the increment "
"will have no impact. For example if you have a start time of 5 minutes, an "
"increment of 10 seconds, and a maximum of 5 minutes, and use 5 seconds on "
"your first first move, the clock will not go up to 5 mintues and 5 seconds, "
"but instead will be capped at 5 minutes."
msgstr ""
"Chess Tempo gebruikt drie factoren om tijd controle te bepalen. De start "
"tijd, de vermeerdering in tijd en de maximum tijd. De start tijd komt "
"overeen met de tijd op de klok, de vermeerdering in tijd is de tijd dewelke "
"wordt toegevoegd na elke zet en de maximum is de maximum tijd waarbij een "
"vermeerdering geen impact meer heeft. Indien je een start tijd hebt van 5 "
"minuten, een vermeerdering van 10 seconden, en een maximum van 5 minuten en "
"je eerste zet reeds doet na 5 seconden, dan zal je maximum tijd maar 5 "

"Using the combination of start, increment and maximum time allows a lot of "

"increment of 3 days, and a maximum time of 3 days. If you think you normally "
"move once every day, but need the flexibility of a playing longer than that "
"during busy periods, a larger maximum and start time might be useful. For "
"example, a start time of 10 days, increment of 1 day and maximum time of 10 "
"days may offer the flexibility you are after, without having to go to 1 move "
"every 3 days. As long as you had been playing at 1 move per day for some "
"time, you could take a week off, and still have 3 days left of your initial "

"evaluation next to each analysis line will be positive if white is ahead, "
"and negative if white is behind, and black is ahead, this is a common "
"convention used in many popular chess applications. If this option is not "
"selected then the evaluation for each line is positive if the player to move "
"is in front and negative if the player to move is behind, this is the same "
"method used in the tactics evaluation display. Moves are coloured green, red "

"The \"Evaluation from white&#39;s View\" option choice only impacts the "

"white's View\" method. This avoids having the sign of the evaluation "
"constantly flip as the side to move changes, which can make scanning a move "
"list annotated with evaluations quite difficult. When reading evaluations "
"inserted in a move list they can be interpreted as the evaluation of the "
